## Installation

To install the code that we used to analyze the data, make sure to have Python installed, and then just type:

```shell
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Analyses

There are two major steps. First, we download the data from the EDICTOR tool, second, we run the script to check for inconsistencies and compare with other sources.

The first script can be called as follows:

```shell
$ python download.py
```

The second script can be run as follows:

```shell
$ python predict-all.py
```
